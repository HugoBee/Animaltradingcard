			<p class="animal-description">Loveable, loud and cuddly. Pugs are great apartment dwellers they love to sit with you while you are reading a book, watching TV or munching on your favorite snack. Be aware though they are very greedy eaters and will eat until they make themselves sick. Pugs will be become your second shadow as you move around your house although not stealhly since their loud breathing and wheezing will give them away. Say goodbye to your sleeping pills as pugs have a way of putting everyone to sleep who's around them.</p>
